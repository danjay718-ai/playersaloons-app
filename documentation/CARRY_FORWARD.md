# PlayerSaloons — Carry Forward Summary
**As of**: 2026-06-20 | **Current version**: v1.39 | **Branch**: `main`

---

## ✅ State ng Project

- Production deployed sa `https://app-testing.website` via Docker Compose + Coolify (Linode)
- SSL active (HTTPS via Let's Encrypt), login working, Horizon active
- PHPStan Level 5 was previously clean on recent feature work; latest v1.37 run exited with code 1 without diagnostics/output in this environment
- `predis/predis` installed — local dev gumagamit ng `REDIS_CLIENT=predis`
- Match confirmation flow now uses canonical `WAITING_FOR_CONFIRMATION`; `RESULT_SUBMITTED` remains legacy-compatible only
- Welcome page header now shows logo image only, without adjacent `PLAYERSALOONS` text
- H2H MVP is now DB-backed with challenge queue, stake lock, match acceptance, result submit/confirm, and winner payout

## 📋 Full Pending Backlog

See `documentation/execution_checklist.md` for complete list. Summary:

| Priority | Item | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| 🟢 | H2H proof upload + admin dispute review | Medium/Large — MVP dispute entry exists, admin resolution pending |
| 🟢 | H2H timeout/auto-expiry policy | Medium — decide and implement fair handling for stale submitted/unresolved duels |
| 🟡 | H2H ELO/skill matching | Optional for v1; matchmaker currently uses game/stake/platform/region |
| 🟢 | Referral system logic | Medium |
| 🔵 | 2FA | Large |
| 🔵 | External payout integration | Large + business decision |
| 🔵 | Compliance/blacklisting, contact inquiries, newsletter admin | Medium/Large |
| 🔵 | CMS Blog/News + translation management | Medium |
| 🟡 | Remaining testing debt | Tournament filters, pagination, elimination modal, N+1 checks |
| ⚪ | R2 storage migration | Deferred during testing; Docker volumes are acceptable until full launch |

### Already Done / Do Not Re-open

- `last_login_at` login update and migration — done v1.29/v1.34
- `UserKycSubmitted` admin listener — done v1.31
- Broadcast Messages admin UI — done v1.35
- Player notification bell — done v1.36
- Match confirmation state mismatch — fixed v1.37
- H2H mock-only challenge queue — replaced with DB-backed MVP v1.39

### H2H Follow-up Scope

- Add proof uploads for H2H result submissions.
- Add admin dispute review and resolution: player A wins, player B wins, refund/void.
- Add timeout policy for stale `WAITING_FOR_CONFIRMATION` H2H matches without creating unfair auto-win behavior.
- Add optional ELO/skill matching after enough player history exists.
