# PlayerSaloons — Feature Map

**Last Updated**: 2026-06-29 (v1.70)

Quick-reference for developers. Maps every feature to its route, Livewire component, backend actions, and test coverage.

For architecture decisions and rationale, see `architecture_baseline.md`.
For step-by-step user flows and file-level details, see `/documentation/`.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture Principles
- **Modular Domain Design**: Business logic under `app/Modules/` by domain.
- **State Machine Driven**: All lifecycle transitions go through `AbstractStateMachine` classes.
- **Ledger-Based Finance**: Immutable `ledger_entries` are the source of truth for all balances.
- **Event-Driven**: Cross-module communication via thin domain events (no Eloquent models in events).
- **Security**: Granular RBAC via Spatie, UUIDs for external IDs, Four-Eyes checks for financial approvals.
- **Actions are self-authorizing**: Role/policy guards live inside Actions, not just at the component level.

### Shared Player Layout Components

| Surface | Component | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Player dashboard topbar | `app/Livewire/Notification/NotificationBell.php` | Shows latest 10 user notifications, unread count, single/all mark-as-read actions, and refreshes from realtime Reverb broadcasts |
| Player toast notifications | `resources/views/components/ui/toasts.blade.php` | Shared toast surface for player-facing `session()->flash()` feedback (`message`, `success`, `info`, `error`, `h2h_status`, `h2h_error`) |
| H2H duel prompt | `app/Livewire/Match/HeadToHeadDuelPrompt.php` | Dashboard-wide polling modal that alerts players when a duel is active or when an open duel invite is available |
| Player loading states | `resources/js/app.js`, `resources/css/app.css`, `resources/views/components/layouts/dashboard.blade.php` | Disables Livewire submit buttons during submit and shows a game-style full-page loader for uncached player `wire:navigate` route changes; tab links are excluded and visited routes are cached in `sessionStorage` |
| Player upload feedback | `resources/views/livewire/profile/profile-dashboard.blade.php` | Shows immediate selected-file feedback and Livewire upload progress for avatar and KYC document uploads |
| Language switcher | `resources/views/components/localization/language-switcher.blade.php` | Reusable locale dropdown shown in guest/public, player, and admin shells; posts to `/language` and reads supported languages from `config/localization.php` |

### Shared Public Layout Components

| Surface | Component/File | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Public navbar | `resources/views/components/layouts/partials/public-navigation.blade.php` | Fixed-position navbar backed by `public_navigation_items`. Transparent over the hero video, transitions to solid dark background on scroll (`initPublicNav()` in `app.js`, `.nav-transparent` / `.nav-solid` CSS classes). Desktop shows nav links; mobile topbar shows only logo + auth actions (Sign In / Join Now or Dashboard shortcut); all other items move into the burger dropdown. |
| Public footer | `resources/views/components/layouts/partials/public-footer.blade.php` | Shared public footer for welcome and public/guest Livewire pages. Reads the active `footer` landing section/items from the database; seeded footer policy links are generated from active `policy_pages`. |
| Landing shell | `resources/views/components/layouts/landing.blade.php` | Full-bleed landing shell for the dynamic homepage. Preloads Orbitron + Inter from Google Fonts. Uses fixed (not sticky) nav so the hero video is visible beneath it on load. |
| Landing page | `resources/views/livewire/landing/landing-page.blade.php` | Esports-themed dynamic landing: full-viewport video hero with `id="hero-video"` for JS replay fallback, CMS-editable sections, horizontal snap-scroll game carousel (`.landing-games-scroll`), glassmorphism cards, animated fade-in content, gradient CTA banner, and managed footer. |
| Landing CSS design system | `resources/css/app.css` (`.landing-*` classes) | All landing styles are prefixed `landing-`. Key classes: `.landing-page-root` (outer overflow clip), `.landing-hero`, `.landing-main-pattern`, `.landing-section-overflow-clip` (sections with decorative orbs), `.landing-games-scroll` (the only permitted horizontal scroll), `.landing-gradient-text`, `.landing-section-title`, `.landing-section-kicker`, `.landing-card`, `.landing-stat-card`, `.landing-cta-primary`, `.landing-fade-in` (+ delay variants), `.landing-top-glow`. |
| Scroll-aware nav JS | `resources/js/app.js` — `initPublicNav()` | Detects `.landing-hero` presence. If found: registers a passive scroll listener and toggles `.nav-transparent` / `.nav-solid` on `#public-nav` at a 60 px threshold. If not found (non-landing pages): always applies `.nav-solid`. Cleans up previous scroll listeners on Livewire SPA navigation to avoid memory leaks. |
| Public shell behavior | `resources/js/app.js` | Handles public mobile burger menu, scroll-aware nav, hero video replay fallback, native PWA install prompt, service worker registration, and lazy authenticated Echo setup. |
| PWA manifest/service worker | `public/manifest.json`, `public/sw.js`, `public/icon-192.png`, `public/icon-512.png` | Installable app metadata, square PWA icons, static asset caching, and network-only HTML navigation so stale landing pages are not served after logout. |
| Horizontal scroll containment | `html, body { overflow-x: hidden }` in `app.css` | Global guard. Decorative sections use `overflow-x: clip`. The only intentional horizontal scroll is `.landing-games-scroll`. |

### Localization Runtime

| Surface | File/Component | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Locale selection | `app/Http/Middleware/SetLocale.php` | Sets `app()->getLocale()` from authenticated `users.locale`, guest session locale, or app fallback. Safely handles requests before a session store is attached. |
| Rendered UI text translation | `app/Http/Middleware/TranslateRenderedHtml.php` | Translates rendered HTML text nodes plus `placeholder`, `title`, `aria-label`, and `alt` attributes by exact JSON key. Also handles Livewire JSON payloads that contain rendered HTML. |
| Supported language list | `config/localization.php` | Defines supported locales: English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, Chinese, and Polish. |
| Runtime files | `lang/*.json` | Laravel JSON translation files used at runtime. Admin edits are exported here from `translation_strings`. |
| Admin editing source | `translation_strings` table | Database-backed phrase catalog edited from `/admin/translations`; JSON files are export/cache output. |
