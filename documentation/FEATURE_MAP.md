# PlayerSaloons — Feature Map

**Last Updated**: 2026-06-21 (v1.56)

Quick-reference for developers. Maps every feature to its route, Livewire component, backend actions, and test coverage.

For architecture decisions and rationale, see `PlayerSaloons_Architecture_Baseline_v1.md`.
For step-by-step user flows and file-level details, see `/documentation/`.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture Principles
- **Modular Domain Design**: Business logic under `app/Modules/` by domain.
- **State Machine Driven**: All lifecycle transitions go through `AbstractStateMachine` classes.
- **Ledger-Based Finance**: Immutable `ledger_entries` are the source of truth for all balances.
- **Event-Driven**: Cross-module communication via thin domain events (no Eloquent models in events).
- **Security**: Granular RBAC via Spatie, UUIDs for external IDs, Four-Eyes checks for financial approvals.
- **Actions are self-authorizing**: Role/policy guards live inside Actions, not just at the component level.
