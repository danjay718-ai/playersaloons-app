# PlayerSaloons — MVP Progress

**Last Updated**: 2026-06-21 (v1.52) | **Branch**: `main`

---

## ✅ PWA / Reverb Console Cleanup (v1.52)

- **PWA meta tags**: Added `mobile-web-app-capable=yes` beside the existing Apple mobile web app meta tag in public, app, and dashboard layouts to satisfy current browser installability expectations.
- **`resources/js/app.js`**: Changed Laravel Echo/Reverb initialization from eager page-load setup to authenticated lazy setup. Guest/public pages no longer attempt WebSocket connections unless a `meta[name="user-uuid"]` exists and Reverb env vars are present.
- **Tests**: `npm run build` passed; `welcome` Blade render check passed.
- **PHPStan**: Not run; frontend/layout-only fix.

## ✅ Shared Public Shell + Mobile Burger Navigation (v1.51)

- **`components.layouts.partials.public-navigation`**: Added one shared public navbar for welcome and guest/public Livewire layouts. Desktop layout keeps logo left, public links centered, and auth/PWA actions right.
- **Mobile nav**: Mobile topbar keeps logo, `Sign In`, `Join Now`, and burger only. PWA install appears inside the collapsible burger menu on mobile to avoid duplicate install CTAs.
- **`components.layouts.partials.public-footer`**: Added a shared public footer so welcome and public/guest pages stay visually synchronized.
- **`components.layouts.app` / `welcome.blade.php`**: Replaced duplicated nav/footer markup with shared includes.
- **Tests**: `npm run build` passed; `welcome` Blade render check passed.
- **PHPStan**: Not run; Blade/JS layout refactor.

## ✅ PWA Install Support (v1.50)

- **PWA assets**: Added `public/manifest.json`, `public/sw.js`, and square install icons (`icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png`).
- **Service worker**: Registers app shell assets and cleans old caches on activation.
- **PWA install flow**: Added native `beforeinstallprompt` handling in `resources/js/app.js`. The install button uses the browser's direct install prompt; no tutorial/manual modal is shown.
- **Layouts**: Added manifest/theme/apple icon meta tags to public, app, and dashboard layouts.
- **Tests**: `npm run build` passed; manifest JSON and service worker syntax were validated during implementation.
- **PHPStan**: Not run; static asset/frontend change.

## ✅ Phase 1 — Migrations & Seeders

## ✅ Phase 2 — Eloquent Models

**32 models** under `app/Modules/*/Models/`. PHPStan Level 8 passing. Key notes:
- **Immutable models** (`LedgerEntry`, `MatchEvidence`, `Refund`, `PrizeDistribution`, `TournamentCancellation`, `TournamentCheckin`, `JobExecutionLog`) — throw `LogicException` on update/delete via `booted()` hooks.
- `GameMatch` maps to the `matches` table to avoid PHP reserved word conflict.
- `User` moved to `app/Modules/Identity/Models/` with custom `newFactory()`.

---

| `InvitationStateMachine` | PENDING→ACCEPTED/DECLINED/EXPIRED/REVOKED | Expiry check |
| `SeatReservationStateMachine` | RESERVED→CONFIRMED/EXPIRED/CANCELLED | — |

**Tests**: `62 unit tests` · 100% passing — [`tests/Unit/StateMachines/`](file:///home/danjay/Projects/playersaloons-app/tests/Unit/StateMachines/)

---

## ✅ Phase 5 — Domain Events

**36 thin domain events** across 7 modules, all extending [`DomainEvent`](file:///home/danjay/Projects/playersaloons-app/app/Shared/Events/DomainEvent.php) (provides `Dispatchable` + immutable `occurredAt`).

Full-featured internal operations dashboard for staff (ADMIN / SUPER_ADMIN roles). Built on Livewire 3 with a dedicated admin layout at `resources/views/components/layouts/admin.blade.php`.

- **Base Class (`app/Livewire/Admin/AdminComponent.php`)**:
  - Abstract base enforcing staff-only access via `boot()` — redirects with 403 if the authenticated user lacks the `ADMIN` or `SUPER_ADMIN` role.

- **Admin Layout (`resources/views/components/layouts/admin.blade.php`)**:
  - Dark professional theme (Slate-950 / Slate-900 surfaces).
  - Responsive sidebar with Lucide icons, mobile burger menu, and live user name/role display.
  - Flash message toast system (success / error / info).

- **Admin Dashboard (`AdminDashboard` → `/admin`)**:
  - Live stats grid: total users, pending KYC, pending withdrawals, active tournaments, ongoing matches, open disputes, platform escrow balance.
  - Recent activity feeds for KYC and withdrawals with quick status badges.

- **Tournament Admin (`TournamentAdmin` → `/admin/tournaments`)**:
  - Searchable, filterable paginated tournament list.
  - Create/Edit modal for draft tournaments (full date/time fields, game selector, fee, participant limits).
  - State-transition buttons (`applyTransition`) covering the full lifecycle: Publish → Open Registration → Close Registration → Open Check-in → Close Check-in → Generate Bracket → Start → Complete → Process Refund.
  - Cancel modal with mandatory reason and audit note.

- **Match Admin (`MatchAdmin` → `/admin/matches`)**:
  - Searchable match list with dispute filter (active disputes highlighted).
  - Result override panel: select winner, write override notes, trigger `MatchStateMachine` override.
  - Dispute resolution panel: view evidence, choose resolution (`PLAYER_A_WINS`, `PLAYER_B_WINS`, `DRAW`, `REMATCH`), resolve via `ResolveDisputeAction`.

- **KYC Admin (`KycAdmin` → `/admin/kyc`)**:
  - Status-filtered KYC queue (SUBMITTED / UNDER_REVIEW / APPROVED / REJECTED).
  - Side-panel detail view with document links, submitted data.
  - One-click Approve or Reject (with mandatory rejection reason note).

- **Withdrawal Admin (`WithdrawalAdmin` → `/admin/withdrawals`)**:
  - Defaults to `PENDING` status filter with search by username / email.
  - Selecting a withdrawal auto-moves it to `UNDER_REVIEW` (four-eyes guard: reviewer ≠ requester).
  - Approve modal (with notes) and Reject modal (mandatory reason).
  - Process Payout button for `APPROVED` withdrawals.
  - Shows linked KYC status and last 10 wallet ledger entries inline.

- **User Admin (`UserAdmin` → `/admin/users`)**:
  - Paginated user list with status and role filters.

- **Routing (`routes/web.php`)**:
  - All admin routes mounted under `/admin` prefix inside the `auth` middleware group:
    - `/admin` · `/admin/tournaments` · `/admin/matches` · `/admin/kyc` · `/admin/withdrawals` · `/admin/users` · `/admin/audit-logs` · `/admin/cms`

- **UI Polish & Role-Based UI Separation (v1.1)**:
  - Implemented dynamic role-based login redirects: players redirect to `/dashboard`, staff/admin roles redirect to `/admin`.
  - Added request-time checks in `PlayerDashboard::mount()` to auto-redirect staff users accessing `/dashboard` to `/admin`.
  - Added "Admin Panel" sidebar and profile dropdown links to `/dashboard` for staff members to easily switch views.
  - Enhanced the admin layout header (desktop & mobile) to show logged-in staff username, dynamic role labels, and dedicated color-coded shields (e.g. red for `SUPER_ADMIN`, indigo for `ADMIN`).
  - Added a sign-out button directly inside the admin header.

- **Bug Fixes**:
  - Renamed `TournamentAdmin::transition()` → `applyTransition()` to avoid conflict with Livewire's reserved `transition()` lifecycle method.
  - Fixed `WithdrawalAdmin::reject()` union type hint (removed erroneous `RejectKycAction` from union).
  - Fixed `TournamentAdmin` validation: replaced `max:max_participants` (invalid cross-field ref) with `lte:max_participants`.
  - Added `rounds()` `hasManyThrough` relationship to `Tournament` model (via `Bracket`).

- **UI Refinements & Fixes (v1.3)**:
  - **Compact Admin Profile Icon**: Refined the admin header layout, making the user display name and role badge more compact and adjusting margins to prevent overlapping.
  - **Action Icons Fix (Global)**: Fixed the bug where clicking action buttons caused the icons (e.g. eye, edit, delete, cancel) to disappear and turn into empty circles. Implemented global Livewire `livewire:init` + `morph.updated` + `message.processed` hooks inside all layout files to auto-re-initialize Lucide icons upon any DOM morphing or request processing.
  - **Livewire DOM Keying (`wire:key`)**: Added unique `wire:key` attributes to table rows (`<tr>`) inside all admin views (`tournament-admin`, `match-admin`, `audit-log-admin`, `cms-admin`, `kyc-admin`, `user-admin`, `withdrawal-admin`) to ensure proper Livewire DOM tracking.
  - **Custom Dark-Neon Pagination**: Styled the default Laravel/Livewire pagination component in `app.css` using custom CSS overrides. The pagination now blends seamlessly with the dark-neon theme (deep slate background, indigo-to-violet gradient for active pages, subtle glow effects).
  - **Tournament Pagination Spacing**: Wrapped the tournament admin pagination in an `mt-6` container for improved visual spacing.

- **Tournament Admin Refactor & CMS Improvements (v1.4)**:
  - Extracted Tournament creation/editing from a modal into a dedicated page (`/admin/tournaments/create` and `/admin/tournaments/{id}/edit`) for better UX and spacious layout.
  - Implemented Livewire's `wire:navigate` for SPA-like lazy loaded transitions between the tournament list and form.
  - Expanded tournament configuration fields (prize pools, team size, checkin/registration timings, etc.) and added an automatic default rules template generator.
  - Added dynamic **Platform Management** to the CMS Admin (`/admin/cms`). Platforms are now database-driven (`platforms` table), configurable via CRUD actions, and automatically populate the platform select dropdown when creating tournaments.
  - Improved CMS UI by replacing browser alerts with a polished custom delete confirmation modal for both CMS Pages and Platforms.

- **Advanced Tournament Features & Performance (v1.5)**:
  - **Modal Optimization**: Integrated Alpine.js for instant modal visibility and backdrop control. Optimized server-side `render()` logic to prevent unnecessary relationship loading when modals are closed. Added `wire:loading` states and skeletons.
  - **Reusable Action Dropdown**: Created a reusable `x-admin.action-dropdown` Blade component for consistent 'kebab' action menus across all admin tables.
  - **Limited Edit Mode**: Implemented "Limited Edit" (Option A) for tournaments, allowing admins to update rules, descriptions, and schedules for published tournaments while locking critical financial/structural fields.
  - **Multi-Step Tournament Wizard**: Refactored the tournament creation/edit form into a 4-step interactive wizard (Identity, Settings, Schedule, Prizes) with strict per-step validation and real-time button disabling.
  - **Rich Text Integration**: Integrated **Quill Rich Text Editor** for tournament descriptions and rules with optimized deferred synchronization to eliminate typing lag.
  - **Expanded Filters & Schedules**: Added "One-time / Single Event" frequency option. Made Platform selection mandatory and implemented Platform/Frequency filters on both Admin and Player tournament lists.
  - **Draft Persistence**: Implemented local persistence using `localStorage` to automatically save tournament drafts, preventing data loss during creation.
  - **Scheduling Guidance**: Added instructional helper notes to Step 3 of the wizard to guide admins on chronological date requirements (Registration < Check-in < Start).
  - **Dynamic Status Badges**: Implemented color-coded status badges for tournament list.
    - *Technical Debt Note*: Currently uses inline styles to bypass CSS compilation issues in the environment. Future refactor needed to revert to standard Tailwind utility classes using a dedicated blade component once build pipeline is stabilized.

- **Tournament Access & Visibility Improvements (v1.7)**:
  - **Player Restriction (Logic)**: Updated `TournamentDetail` to enforce 'PLAYER' role requirement for registration in the backend.
  - **Player Restriction (UI)**: Updated `tournament-detail.blade.php` to hide the 'Join' button and show an informative message for non-player roles.
  - **Tournament Visibility**: Refactored `TournamentList` to filter out inactive statuses (Draft, Completed, Cancelled, Refunded) by default, showing only active tournaments (Registration, Check-in, Ongoing).

- **Tournament Lifecycle & Admin Control Improvements (v1.14)**:
  - **State Rollbacks**: Implemented valid state transition rollbacks in `TournamentStateMachine` (e.g., re-opening check-in from closed status), allowing for better tournament management flexibility.
  - **Check-in Validation Guard**: Added a mandatory participant count validation (`guardCanCloseCheckin`) to prevent premature check-in closure if tournament participation requirements are not met.
  - **Admin UI Enhancements**: Exposed new rollback transitions ('Re-open Registration', 'Re-open Check-in') directly in the Admin Tournament action dropdown for immediate workflow adjustment.
  - **Bug Fix**: Added missing `checkins()` relationship to the `Tournament` model to support participation validation logic.

- **Head-to-Head Feature Modularization (v1.11)**:
  - **Dedicated H2H Page**: Extracted 'Head-to-Head' duels from the `PlayerDashboard` into a dedicated Livewire page (`/head-to-head`), improving load times and simplifying the dashboard DOM.
  - **Prototype/Mock Implementation**: Current H2H functionality uses mock in-memory data for UI demonstration. Production implementation (backend tables, matchmaking engine, websockets) is tracked in [PlayerSaloons_Execution_Checklist_v1.md].
  - **Navigation Update**: Updated sidebar to include a direct link to the new H2H page and removed H2H tab from the main dashboard.

- **Dashboard Redesign (v1.13)**:
  - **Cockpit Overview**: Refactored the `PlayerDashboard` to act as a lightweight 'Cockpit' overview. It now features widgets for user welcome/balance, recent matches, upcoming tournaments, progression stats, announcements, and a video placeholder.
  - **Tabbed Navigation**: Re-implemented tabbed navigation within the dashboard to allow quick switching between the Cockpit view and the new dedicated pages (My Tournaments, Browse Tournaments, H2H, Leaderboards, Streams, Chat).

- **Match Resolution Automation (v1.16)**:
  - **Match Startup Automation**: Implemented `AutoStartMatchesListener` and updated `AdvanceWinnerListener` to automatically transition 'READY' matches to 'IN_PROGRESS' when a tournament starts or a player advances, enabling immediate action for participants.
  - **Backfill Command**: Created `tournaments:start-matches` Artisan command to manually fix matches stuck in 'READY' status for ongoing tournaments.
  - **AutoForfeitJob Registration**: Registered `AutoForfeitJob` in the Laravel scheduler to run every minute.
  - **Infrastructure Requirement**: Production deployment requires a configured cron job (`php artisan schedule:run`) and a persistent queue worker (`php artisan queue:work`) supervised process.
  - **Testing Coverage (v1.23)**: Implemented `ConfirmResultFlowTest` validating successful opponent confirmation, winner advancement/progression, and `AutoForfeitJob` timeout resolution.

- **Tournament UI Enhancements (v1.17)**:
  - **Persistent Tabs**: Implemented `localStorage` state persistence for tournament content tabs using Alpine.js, scoped per tournament ID.
  - **Activity Feed Tab**: Added a new 'Activity' tab featuring a vertical timeline layout to display chronological tournament events (`$tournament->activities`).
  - **Mobile Layout & Usability**: Re-designed the navigation tab container to use horizontal scrolling on mobile devices to prevent wrapping breakages, and applied `whitespace-nowrap`.
  - **Simplified Terminology**: Renamed default tabs from 'Intel/Warriors/Battle Grid' to clearer 'Overview/Players/Matches'.

- **Tournament Elimination Warning Modal (v1.18)**:
  - **Elimination Verification**: Calculates `$hasLost` status inside `TournamentDetail` by checking if the logged-in player has a resolved match (`COMPLETED` or `FORFEITED`) in the tournament where they are not the winner.
  - **Alpine.js Warning Modal**: Shows a custom modal with a skull icon notifying players that they are eliminated when selecting the Matches tab.
  - **Navigation Flow**: Provides a "Go Back" option (reverts tab to Overview) and a "Continue" option (allows them to proceed viewing matches).

- **My Tournaments UI Redesign (v1.19)**:
  - **Player Statistics Banner**: Added a top row statistics grid showing Active Tournaments, Tournament History, Match Victories (Wins), and Match Defeats (Losses).
  - **Active Tab Alignment**: Re-designed active tournament cards to match the neon styling, banner images, status badges, and fee/prize layouts of the Browse Tournaments page.
  - **History List View**: Re-engineered the history tab as a detailed chronological list item view displaying game category, end date, and user match histories (including round number, opponent name, and custom outcome badges like "WON" or "LOST").
  - **Elimination Lifecycle Shift**: Tournaments where a player has lost are immediately moved from the "Active" tab to the "History" tab, and the stats banner counts reflect this database-driven status.

- **Performance Optimizations (v1.20)**:
  - **Eager Loading Counts**: Implemented `withCount` on active tournament registrations for both browse and player listings, replacing inline loop queries with optimized database subqueries (`registrations_count`).
  - **Pre-fetched Matches**: Replaced loop-level N+1 query structures on `/my-tournaments` page by pre-fetching all player matches for paginated tournaments in a single DB query, reducing page load queries drastically.
  - **Eager Activity Logs**: Swapped inline database loops for Spatie activity logs in `player-content.blade.php` with the pre-fetched `$activityLogs` collection passed from the component.

- **File Storage Fix & Restriction (v1.21)**:
  - **S3/R2 Removed Locally**: Switched dispute evidence (`SubmitEvidenceAction`) and match result proof (`SubmitMatchResultAction`) uploads from the `r2` disk to the local `public` disk, resolving the `Class "League\Flysystem\AwsS3V3\PortableVisibilityConverter" not found` error.
  - **Images Only, 2MB Cap**: Restricted allowed file types to images only (PNG, JPG, WEBP) and capped size at 2MB for both upload flows. Removed PDF and video (MP4/MOV) support for now.
  - **Validation Sync**: Updated Livewire `MatchDetail` component validation for both `evidenceFile` and `submissionProof` to reflect the new limits (`max:2048`, `mimes:png,jpg,jpeg,webp`).
  - **UI Copy Updated**: Updated hint text and dispute description in `match-detail.blade.php` to reflect the new restrictions.
  - **Storage URL Compatibility**: Existing blade templates already used `/storage/{{ $path }}` for both fields — confirmed correct for the `public` disk with no additional changes.
  - **Deployment Note**: Added `🚀 Deployment Considerations` section to this file with a step-by-step checklist to migrate back to R2/S3 before going live.

- **Match Result Confirmation Fixes (v1.23)**:
  - **`confirmResult` Stub Fixed**: The `MatchDetail::confirmResult()` Livewire method was a no-op stub (`// ... (existing method)`). Implemented the full body: load match with relations, auth guard, delegate to `ConfirmMatchResultAction`, and flash messages.
  - **`MatchCompleted::dispatch()` TypeError Fixed**: `ConfirmMatchResultAction::execute()` was passing a `GameMatch` object to `MatchCompleted::dispatch()` but the event constructor expects `(int $matchId, int $tournamentId, int $winnerRegistrationId)`. Fixed by extracting `winner_registration_id` from the latest submission, persisting it on the match, and dispatching with correct `int` arguments.
  - **`BracketGenerationService`**: Fixed unsafe Eloquent Collection index access (`$participants[(int)]` → `$participants->get(int)`) by adding `.values()` after `orderBy()`. Renamed `$p` → `$bracketSize` for clarity. Extracted `nextPowerOfTwo()` as a private method. Documented that `TournamentParticipant` rows are exclusively checked-in players (created by `CheckinParticipantAction`), so no additional filter is needed.
  - **`Prize Pool Retention`**: Fixed a bug where a manually set or guaranteed prize pool in the tournament wizard was overwritten with `0.00` when registration closed (or when completing a tournament). Updated `CloseRegistrationAction` and `PrizeCalculationService` to retain the higher of the manually entered prize pool and the calculated registration fees (minus platform rake).
  - **Testing Coverage (v1.23)**: Implemented unit tests for `BracketGenerationService` covering 2, 5, 6, and 8 player tournament bracket generation structures (byes math & propagation). Implemented feature tests for the complete `confirmResult` → `MatchCompleted` → `AdvanceWinnerListener` flow and the `AutoForfeitJob` timeout mechanism.

- **Admin Dispute Evidence UI (v1.22)**:
  - **Detail Modal — Dispute Section Redesign**: Replaced the plain file-link list with a full dispute card per dispute showing: filed-by user with timestamp, status badge (open/under_review/resolved with distinct colours), player's note/reason in a labelled block, and a 2-column image thumbnail grid (clickable to open full image in new tab) with hover overlay showing uploader name. Fallback for broken image links included.
  - **Resolve CTA Scope Expanded**: The "Resolve Dispute" button now appears for both `open` and `under_review` dispute statuses (previously only `open`).
  - **Dispute Resolution Modal Upgraded**: Widened from `max-w-md` to `max-w-2xl`, made scrollable (`max-h-[90vh]`). Now eager-loads `openedBy` and `evidence.uploadedBy` relations. Shows: filed-by header with status badge, player note block, evidence image thumbnail grid (with zoom-in hover overlay), then the admin ruling radio buttons (with `has-[:checked]` highlight styles for emerald/amber). Submit button renamed to "Submit Ruling" with a gavel icon.
  - **No backend changes required**: All data was already available via existing relations; only the Blade template was updated.


- **Tournament Admin Features (v1.6-1.11)**:
  - Need to add feature tests for:
    - Admin Tournament Filter Persistence (`TournamentAdmin` component).
    - Frequency tabs functionality in admin and player contexts.
    - Custom pagination component rendering.
    - Role-based restriction on the 'Join Tournament' button.
    - Tournament status filtering on player-side listing.
    - Restricted details view (`viewRestrictedDetails` policy) limiting Players, Matches, and Activity tabs visibility to registered participants, organizers, and admins.
  - Need to add component tests for:
    - `TournamentDetail` elimination modal:
      - Player has lost -> navigating to Matches tab triggers warning modal.
      - Player has not lost -> navigating to Matches tab does not trigger modal.
      - Clicking "Go Back" in modal resets active tab to "Overview".
      - Clicking "Continue" in modal closes the modal and keeps active tab on "Matches".
    - `MyTournamentsList` logic and styling:
      - Calculating stats banner counts (active, history, wins, losses) directly from DB aggregates.
      - Active tab matching Browse page cards.
      - History tab presenting lists of user match details (opponent, round, win/loss badge).
      - Player elimination shifting tournaments from the Active list to the History list.
      - N+1 query check (ensuring matches and registration counts are retrieved in grouped queries rather than nested loops).
    - `PlayerTournamentList` (Browse Tournaments filtering).
    - `HeadToHeadList` (matchmaking simulation, challenge creation).
  - Need to add integration/E2E tests for:
    - Navigation between dashboard, my-tournaments, and browse-tournaments pages.

## ✅ PHPStan Fixes (v1.25)

Resolved 5 PHPStan Level 8 errors across Match, Wallet, and Tournament modules.

- **`GameMatch` model**: Added missing `@property Carbon|null $result_submitted_at` to PHPDoc. The column was already cast to `datetime` but not declared, causing a `string|null` type mismatch when assigning `Carbon::now()` in `SubmitMatchResultAction`.
- **`Wallet` model**: Added `@property WalletStatus $status` PHPDoc. Without it, PHPStan inferred the property as `string` (from the `$fillable` array), making strict enum comparisons (`=== WalletStatus::FROZEN/SUSPENDED`) in `WalletService` always evaluate to false.
- **`TournamentModuleTest`**: Fixed `AutoCancelTournamentJob::dispatchSync($tournament->id)` → `dispatchSync()`. The job has no constructor and queries tournaments internally; passing an argument violated the Larastan `larastan.jobs.noConstructor` rule.

---

## 🚀 Deployment Considerations

### File Storage — Switch Local → R2/S3

Currently, all user-uploaded files (dispute evidence screenshots and match result proof images) are stored on the **local `public` disk** (`storage/app/public/`). This works for local development but is **not suitable for production** (files won't persist across deployments and won't scale).

**Before going live:**
1. Install the required adapter: `composer require league/flysystem-aws-s3-v3`.
2. Set the correct `.env` variables for Cloudflare R2 (or AWS S3):
   - `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `R2_BUCKET`, `R2_ENDPOINT`, `R2_PUBLIC_URL`
3. In `SubmitEvidenceAction::execute()` — change disk from `'public'` → `'r2'`.
4. In `SubmitMatchResultAction::execute()` — change disk from `'public'` → `'r2'`.
5. Update any file URL helpers (currently `/storage/{{ $path }}`) to use `Storage::disk('r2')->url($path)` so URLs resolve correctly from R2/CDN.
6. Run `php artisan storage:link` if keeping any local public files on the server.

> **Note:** File type restriction is currently **images only** (PNG, JPG, WEBP, max 2MB). If video evidence is needed in production, update `SubmitEvidenceAction::ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES` and the Livewire validation in `MatchDetail.php` accordingly.

---

## ✅ Financial Operations Audit & Fixes (v1.26)

Audited the full financial operations flow against `documentation/03_financial_operations.md`. Fixed source bugs, resolved PHPStan errors, aligned all tests to the correct architecture.

- **`ProcessWithdrawalAction`**: Removed erroneous `WalletService::debit()` call. Debit is handled by `CreateLedgerEntryListener` on `WithdrawalApproved` (async/queued). Added missing role guard (`FINANCE_OPERATOR / ADMIN / SUPER_ADMIN`). Added `processed_at` stamp.
- **`CreateLedgerEntryListener`**: Fixed idempotency on `WithdrawalApproved`. Old guard (`status !== APPROVED`) was insufficient — on queue retry the status is still `APPROVED`, causing double debit. Now checks for existing `LedgerEntry` with matching `reference_type + reference_id` before debiting.
- **`MatchStateMachine`**: Fixed a historical result-submission mismatch. This note was superseded in v1.37 when `WAITING_FOR_CONFIRMATION` became the canonical post-submission state and `RESULT_SUBMITTED` was retained only for legacy compatibility.
- **`TournamentStateMachine`**: Added missing `COMPLETED → REFUNDED` and `CANCELLED → REFUNDED` transitions (`REFUNDED` existed in the enum but not in the transition table). Extracted `activity()` call into a `protected logTransition()` method so unit tests can override it without hitting the `activity_log` DB table.
- **`Withdrawal` model**: Added `@property WithdrawalStatus $status` PHPDoc. Added `processed_at` to `$fillable` and `casts`. Fixed `$fillable` PHPDoc to `list<string>`. Fixed `BelongsTo` return type PHPDoc to `BelongsTo<T, $this>`.
- **`Deposit` model**: Added `fee_amount` to `$fillable` and `casts`. Fixed `$fillable` PHPDoc. Fixed `BelongsTo` return type PHPDoc.
- **`KycSubmission` model**: Added `@property KycStatus $status` PHPDoc. Fixed `$fillable` PHPDoc to `list<string>`.
- **`WithdrawalStateMachine`**: Added null-safety guards for `$kyc` and `$wallet` before calling approval guards.
- **Docblock fixes**: Removed duplicate `float` in `@param string|float|float $amount` in `ProcessDepositAction` and `RequestWithdrawalAction`.
- **`TournamentStateMachineTest`**: Switched to anonymous subclass overriding `logTransition()` to suppress `activity_log` DB calls in unit tests.
- **Tests**: 88 tests passing (40 wallet feature + 48 state machine unit). Added 7 new test cases covering deposit idempotency, reject withdrawal, process withdrawal role guard, process withdrawal status/timestamp, `CreateLedgerEntryListener` debit, listener idempotency, and ledger sum = cached balance.
- **PHPStan**: 0 errors on all modified files at Level 5.

---

## ✅ Team Module Fixes & Convention Alignment (v1.27)

Audited Team module against `documentation/04_team_management.md`. Fixed PHPStan errors, applied missing conventions, wired unused components, and aligned docs to reality.

- **Models (`Team`, `TeamMember`, `TeamInvitation`)**: Added `declare(strict_types=1)`. Fixed `$fillable` PHPDoc from `array<int, string>` → `list<string>` to satisfy covariant override constraint (PHPStan Level 5, 3 errors resolved).
- **`InvitationStateMachine`**: Was completely unused — actions were directly mutating `$invitation->status`. Wired into `AcceptTeamInvitationAction`, `DeclineTeamInvitationAction`, and `RevokeTeamInvitationAction` via constructor injection.
- **Event Dispatch**: All 7 team events existed but were never dispatched. Fixed by emitting the correct event from each action: `TeamCreated`, `TeamUpdated`, `TeamDeleted`, `TeamMemberInvited`, `TeamMemberJoined`, `TeamMemberRemoved`, `TeamCaptainChanged`. Added `User $actingUser` param to `UpdateTeamAction`, `DisbandTeamAction`, and `RemoveTeamMemberAction` to carry actor ID into events.
- **`04_team_management.md`**: Corrected stale test names (`test_captain_can_invite_player` → `test_can_invite_user`, etc.), added all 11 test cases across 4 sections, fixed `teams.logo_url` → `teams.logo_path`.
- **Tests**: Updated test file to use `app()` for DI-injected actions and pass the required `User` actor arg. All **11 team tests passing**.

---

## ✅ Phase 6 — Identity Module Fixes & Test Coverage Audit (v1.24)

Audited the full Identity & Onboarding flow against `documentation/01_identity_onboarding.md`. Fixed source bugs, aligned tests to the doc-specified names and assertions, and removed dead code.

- **`RegisterUserAction`**: Moved `UserRegistered::dispatch()` outside `DB::transaction()`. Previously the event could be picked up by a queued listener before the transaction committed, causing a missing-row race condition.
- **`SubmitKycAction`**: Replaced `(new KycSubmission)->newQuery()` with `KycSubmission::query()`. Removed unreachable `$path === false` guard (file is already validated before `store()` is called).
- **`CreateWalletListener`**: Replaced `(new Wallet)->newQuery()` with `Wallet::query()`.
- **`KycSubmission`, `User` models**: Added `declare(strict_types=1)` to match module convention.
- **`ProfileDashboard`**: Removed dead `resolveView()` pass-through method; calls `->layout()` directly on the view. Removed unused `Factory` / `View` imports.
- **`RegisterUserActionTest`**: Renamed to doc-specified method names. Fixed wallet balance assertion (`'0'` → `'0.00'`). Added `Event::assertDispatched(UserRegistered::class)`. Split wallet assertion into `test_wallet_is_created_after_registration`. Added `test_registration_fails_with_invalid_email` and `test_registration_fails_with_existing_username`.
- **`SubmitKycActionTest`**: Renamed to doc-specified method names. Fixed `'national_id'` → `'id_card'` (must match `ProfileDashboard` allowed values: `passport`, `id_card`, `drivers_license`). Added `Event::assertDispatched(UserKycSubmitted::class)` to the success test.
- **`01_identity_onboarding.md`**: Updated to reflect post-transaction event dispatch, explicit KYC document type list, corrected test assertion details, and added `UserKycSubmitted` no-listener gap note.

---

## ✅ Admin Operations Audit & Staff Activity Feature (v1.28)

Audited the full Admin & Operations flow against `documentation/05_admin_operations.md`. Fixed security gaps, resolved PHPStan errors, corrected a failing test, and delivered the Staff Activity Dashboard.

### Security Fixes
- **`WithdrawalAdmin::approve()` and `processPayout()`**: Added missing `$reviewer->can('approve', $withdrawal)` policy guard at the Livewire layer. Previously the `WithdrawalPolicy` four-eyes check was enforced inside the action but bypassed at the component level — inconsistent with the KYC pattern (`KycAdmin` correctly calls `$reviewer->can()` before delegating).
- **`ResolveDisputeAction`**: Changed signature from `int $resolvedByAdminUserId` to `User $actor`. Added `hasAnyRole(['ADMIN', 'SUPER_ADMIN'])` role guard. The action was the only one in the codebase without an authorization check; if called directly (outside `MatchAdmin`) there was no gate. Updated `MatchAdmin::resolveDispute()` to pass `Auth::user()` instead of `Auth::id()`.

### PHPStan Level 5 Fixes
- **`CmsAdmin`** (3 errors):
  - `published_at = now()` → `update(['published_at' => now()])` to avoid `Carbon` assigned to `string|null` property (the cast is on the model, not reflected in the bare property type).
  - `$translation?->name ?? ''` and `$translation?->content ?? ''` → explicit `@var ModelClass|null` PHPDoc + ternary, resolving `nullsafe.neverNull` from Larastan inferring `first()` as non-nullable on a typed `HasMany`.
- **`TournamentForm`** (2 errors):
  - `$tournament->rules` resolved to the `HasMany` relation collection (not the string column) due to PHPDoc `@property-read Collection|TournamentRule[] $rules`. Fixed by using `$tournament->getAttribute('rules')` to explicitly retrieve the raw column value.
  - `Game::first()?->id ?? 0` → `@var Game|null` PHPDoc + ternary, resolving `nullsafe.neverNull`.
- **`AdminPanelTest`** (1 error): Removed dead `$superAdmin` property that was written in `setUp()` but never read.

### Test Fix
- **`test_tournament_admin_can_create_tournament`**: Was calling `->test(TournamentAdmin::class)` and setting `$name`, which doesn't exist on `TournamentAdmin`. Tournament creation was extracted to `TournamentForm` in v1.4. Fixed to use `TournamentForm::class` and supplied all required fields (`platform_id`, `description`, `rules`, `frequency`, `team_size`, `waiting_result_time`).

### New Feature — Staff Activity Dashboard
- **`app/Livewire/Admin/StaffActivityDashboard.php`**: New Livewire component at `/admin/staff-activity`. Restricted to `ADMIN` and `SUPER_ADMIN` (enforced in `boot()`). Displays per-staff action counts with breakdown by event type, date-range and username filters (defaults to last 7 days), and a top-10 actions summary across all staff in the period.
- **`resources/views/livewire/admin/staff-activity-dashboard.blade.php`**: Dark-neon styled table matching admin panel design system. Shows staff member, role badge, total action count, inline action breakdown pills, and last-active timestamp.
- **Route**: Added `Route::get('/staff-activity', StaffActivityDashboard::class)->name('admin.staff-activity')` to the admin prefix group in `routes/web.php`.

### Documentation
- **`documentation/05_admin_operations.md`**: Updated to reflect all security fixes (policy guards, `ResolveDisputeAction` actor change), corrected `AssignRoleAction` note (SUPER_ADMIN only, not all admins), added Section 6 for Staff Activity Dashboard, updated test case list including new staff activity tests, and removed the `test_staff_redirect_from_player_dashboard` pending test (already covered by `test_admin_visiting_player_dashboard_redirects_to_admin_dashboard`).

### Tests
- **4 new tests** in `AdminPanelTest`: `test_player_cannot_access_staff_activity_dashboard`, `test_admin_can_access_staff_activity_dashboard`, `test_staff_activity_dashboard_shows_staff_members`, `test_staff_activity_dashboard_filters_by_date`, `test_staff_activity_dashboard_filters_by_staff_name`.
- **All 21 `AdminPanelTest` tests passing**. PHPStan Level 5: 0 errors across all modified files.

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

**First deployed**: 2026-06-18 via Docker Compose + Coolify on Linode (IP: 139.162.61.8)
**Domain**: app-testing.website (HTTPS — SSL active via Coolify/Let's Encrypt)

### Current Production Setup
- Docker Compose: `docker-compose.prod.yml`
- 5 containers: `app` (nginx + php-fpm), `reverb`, `worker` (Horizon), `scheduler`, `mysql`, `redis`
- `.env` loaded via Coolify environment variables UI

### Issues Encountered on First Deploy

**1. Login redirect loop (`/login?_token=...&identity=...&password=...`)**
- **Cause A**: No `trustProxies` configured — Laravel behind Coolify/Traefik didn't know it was receiving HTTPS-proxied requests, causing session/cookie inconsistency.
- **Fix A**: Added `$middleware->trustProxies(at: '*')` in `bootstrap/app.php`.
- **Cause B**: `SESSION_ENCRYPT=true` — encrypted sessions failed to decrypt on container restart/redeploy due to key loading inconsistency.
- **Fix B**: Set `SESSION_ENCRYPT=false`.
- **Cause C**: `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true` but site was on HTTP — browser refused to send secure cookie over non-HTTPS.
- **Fix C**: Set `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=false` until SSL is configured.
- **Cause D**: Old session cookies in browser from local dev.
- **Fix D**: Clear browser cookies for the domain, or use incognito to test.

**2. `APP_URL=http://localhost`**
- Caused incorrect redirects and CSRF origin mismatches.
- Fix: Set `APP_URL=https://app-testing.website`.

### Pre-Deployment Checklist (For Future Deploys)

```
✅ bootstrap/app.php → trustProxies(at: '*') is present
✅ APP_URL = exact HTTPS domain
✅ APP_ENV = production
✅ APP_DEBUG = false
✅ SESSION_DRIVER = redis
✅ SESSION_DOMAIN = yourdomain.com
✅ SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE = true (only after SSL is active)
✅ SESSION_ENCRYPT = false
✅ REDIS_HOST = redis (container service name, not localhost)
✅ DB_HOST = mysql (container service name, not localhost)
✅ REVERB_HOST = domain name (not raw IP)
✅ REVERB_SCHEME = https, REVERB_PORT = 443 (after SSL)
✅ php artisan config:cache runs on deploy (handled in start.sh)
✅ php artisan migrate --force runs on deploy (handled in start.sh)
```

### SSL Setup (Coolify — Let's Encrypt)
1. In Coolify dashboard → your application → **Domains** section
2. Enter domain: `app-testing.website`
3. Enable HTTPS/SSL toggle (Coolify + Traefik handle Let's Encrypt automatically)
4. After SSL is active, update `.env`: `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true`, `REVERB_SCHEME=https`, `REVERB_PORT=443`
5. Restart (not full redeploy needed for `.env`-only changes)

### Pending Production Work
- [x] Configure SSL via Coolify (Let's Encrypt) *(done v1.30)*
- [x] Update `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true`, `REVERB_SCHEME=https`, `REVERB_PORT=443` after SSL *(done v1.30)*
- [x] Verify Horizon dashboard and queue workers are processing *(confirmed active v1.29)*
- [x] `php artisan storage:link` — handled in `start.sh` on deploy
- [ ] Migrate file storage to R2/S3 — deferred, see `execution_checklist.md` → File Storage Migration

## ✅ UI Harmonization & Secure KYC Storage (v1.49)
- **KYC Identity Module**: Reverted `SubmitKycAction.php` back to storing KYC IDs on the `local` private disk instead of `public` to secure sensitive identity documents from direct public access.
- **Admin Panel**: Added a secure protected route (`/admin/kyc/document/{path}`) to stream KYC files. Access requires ADMIN or KYC_REVIEWER roles. Updated `kyc-admin.blade.php` to use this secure endpoint.
- **UI/UX Fixes**:
  - Re-styled the `player-welcome-panel` in the Player Dashboard to perfectly match the sci-fi aesthetics of the Wallet Dashboard card. Replaced "Total Earnings" with "Available Balance" for exact consistency.
  - Fixed horizontal overflow on mobile for the notification bell dropdown by implementing responsive `fixed` positioning, creating a clean full-width floating panel below the header on small screens.
  - Fixed bottom spacing issue for mobile pages by increasing `padding-bottom` in `.player-main-content` to `6.5rem`, ensuring no content hides behind the new fixed bottom navbar.
- **Configuration**: Updated `APP_URL` in `.env` to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` so `Storage::url()` generates correct absolute URLs locally for avatars.
- **Tests**: 4 new tests for `KycDocumentRouteTest` to ensure role-based document streaming security.
- **PHPStan**: 0 errors at Level 5. Fixed `Route::get` redundant parameter error in `routes/web.php`.

## ✅ S3 Avatar Upload Support (v1.48)
- **Identity Module**: Added missing `league/flysystem-aws-s3-v3` package.
- Restored `UploadAvatarAction.php` to use `spatie/laravel-medialibrary` instead of local public disk.
- Enables safe persistent avatar uploads using S3-compatible endpoints (MinIO/R2) in stateless Docker/Coolify containers without relying on volume mappings.
- **Views**: Restored `$user->getFirstMediaUrl('avatar')` usage in `profile-dashboard.blade.php`.

## ✅ Mobile Layout Navigation UI Redesign (v1.47)
- **UI/UX**: Replaced the traditional mobile sidebar/burger drawer with a modern fixed-bottom navigation bar.
- Uses dynamic `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` for mobile notch support.
- Added a slide-up "More" panel (`#mobile-more-panel`) with spring-curve animations for secondary navigation items (Wallet, Profile, Teams, Admin).
- Completely pure CSS and vanilla JS; zero server roundtrips required for toggle actions.

## ✅ Player Profile Client-Side Interaction Optimization (v1.46)

- **`profile-dashboard.blade.php`**: Converted tab switching and KYC drawer open/close from Livewire actions to Alpine state, eliminating server round trips for those interactions.
- **`ProfileDashboard`**: Added Redis-backed caching for the curated timezone list and short-lived latest KYC lookup, with database fallback if Redis is unavailable.
- **Comms Loadout**: Replaced `wire:model.live` + `wire:change` with one lightweight preference update action per toggle and skipped full re-render after persistence.
- **Tests**: `php artisan test tests/Feature/Identity/ProfileDashboardTest.php` passed.
- **PHPStan**: Not rerun for this optimization pass.

## ✅ Player Profile Tabs + Render Optimization (v1.45)

- **`ProfileDashboard`**: Added server-side tab state and replaced the full `timezone_identifiers_list()` render with a curated timezone list that also preserves the player's existing saved timezone.
- **`profile-dashboard.blade.php`**: Moved profile/account/security/comms editors behind tabs so the initial page does not render every editable section at once. Profile picture upload now lives in the Profile tab.
- **Comms Loadout**: Switched preference toggles to live model updates and verified backend persistence through `notification_preferences`.
- **Tests**: `php artisan test tests/Feature/Identity/ProfileDashboardTest.php` passed with 7 tests / 22 assertions.
- **PHPStan**: Not rerun for this optimization pass.

## ✅ Player Profile Redesign + KYC Drawer (v1.44)

- **`ProfileDashboard`**: Added database-backed account editing, profile picture upload, password change, profile email verification, and drawer state for KYC submission.
- **`profile-dashboard.blade.php`**: Rebuilt the player profile as a game-style player card with verified/not verified KYC status, hover info explaining withdrawal requirements, verified email field/button, referral copy control, profile/account/password panels, notification toggles, and KYC upload moved out of the main UI into a drawer.
- **`ProfileDashboardTest`**: Added 6 feature tests covering render behavior, profile/account persistence, email verification, password change, and KYC drawer visibility.
- **Docs**: Updated `FEATURE_MAP.md` and `01_identity_onboarding.md`.
- **Tests**: `php artisan test tests/Feature/Identity/ProfileDashboardTest.php` passed.
- **PHPStan**: `./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse` exited with code 1 and no diagnostics/output in this environment.

## ✅ H2H Timeout / Auto-Expiry Policy (v1.43)

- **`ExpireHeadToHeadMatchesJob`**: New scheduled job for conservative H2H timeout handling. Waiting challenges past `expires_at` become `EXPIRED` and refund the creator stake. Stale `IN_PROGRESS` and `WAITING_FOR_CONFIRMATION` matches move to `DISPUTED` with a system timeout note for admin review.
- **`HeadToHeadMatchStateMachine`**: Allows `IN_PROGRESS -> DISPUTED` so stale duels can escalate without auto-awarding a winner.
- **Scheduler**: Registered the H2H timeout job to run every minute in `routes/console.php`.
- **Tests**: Added coverage for expired challenge refund, stale in-progress escalation, and stale submitted-result escalation without payout. `php artisan test tests/Feature/Match/HeadToHeadModuleTest.php` passes: 14 tests, 59 assertions.
- **PHPStan**: Not rerun; previous attempts exited with code 1 and no diagnostics/output in this environment.

---

## ✅ Wallet Deposit UI Refresh Fix (v1.42)

- **`WalletDashboard`**: Reloads wallet data through a fresh relationship query during deposit/render so the updated balance and ledger feed appear immediately after a mock deposit.
- **Tests**: Added `WalletDashboardTest` covering same-response balance refresh after deposit. `php artisan test tests/Feature/Wallet/WalletDashboardTest.php` passes: 1 test, 5 assertions.
- **PHPStan**: Not rerun; previous attempts exited with code 1 and no diagnostics/output in this environment.

---

## ✅ H2H Wallet Error Handling + Backfill (v1.41)

- **`HeadToHeadList`**: Catches expected H2H domain failures from create/find/accept/cancel/result actions and displays player-readable errors instead of raw exception pages.
- **Wallet backfill migration**: Added an idempotent migration that creates active zero-balance wallets for existing users missing wallet rows. Rollback is intentionally no-op to avoid deleting financial records.
- **Local repair**: Applied the migration locally; users without wallets went from 51 to 0.
- **Tests**: Added missing-wallet and insufficient-balance `findDuel` regressions. `php artisan test tests/Feature/Match/HeadToHeadModuleTest.php` passes: 11 tests, 44 assertions.
- **PHPStan**: Not rerun; previous v1.40 PHPStan attempts exited with code 1 and no diagnostics/output in this environment.

---

## ✅ H2H Proof Upload + Admin Dispute Review (v1.40)

- **`head_to_head_matches`**: Added result proof, dispute notes/proof, disputed-by, admin resolution, resolver, and resolved-at fields.
- **`HeadToHeadList`**: Result submitters can attach proof screenshots; opponents can attach dispute notes/proof before escalating to admin review.
- **`ResolveHeadToHeadDisputeAction` / `MatchAdmin`**: Admins can review H2H disputes from `/admin/matches` and award creator, award opponent, or void/refund both stakes through ledger-backed wallet actions.
- **Tests**: Added H2H proof/dispute storage, admin winner payout, admin void/refund, and `MatchAdmin` component coverage. `php artisan test tests/Feature/Match/HeadToHeadModuleTest.php` passes: 9 tests, 40 assertions.
- **PHPStan**: `./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse` still exits with code 1 and no diagnostics/output in this environment, including raw and verbose modes. PHP syntax checks passed for changed PHP files.
- **Full suite note**: `php artisan test` currently has unrelated existing failures: Redis unavailable for online presence in `UserAdmin`, API match dispute controller calling `OpenDisputeAction` with too few arguments, `match_disputes.reason` fixture missing, and an `ADMIN` role setup issue in one KYC test.

---

## ✅ H2H Production MVP (v1.39)

- **`HeadToHeadList`**: Replaced mock in-memory H2H challenge data with DB-backed challenge queue, open challenge list, personal duel list, game handle capture, result submission, confirmation, and dispute entry point.
- **`head_to_head_challenges` / `head_to_head_matches`**: Added persisted H2H schema with game/platform, stake amount, handles, timers, statuses, result submission, and completion fields.
- **Actions/Services**: Added `CreateHeadToHeadChallengeAction`, `AcceptHeadToHeadChallengeAction`, `CancelHeadToHeadChallengeAction`, `SubmitHeadToHeadResultAction`, `ConfirmHeadToHeadResultAction`, `DisputeHeadToHeadResultAction`, stake lock/refund/payout actions, and `HeadToHeadMatchmakerService`.
- **Wallet**: Added `H2H_STAKE` and `H2H_PAYOUT` ledger types. Stakes are debited when queued/accepted; confirmed winner receives both stakes via ledger-backed payout.
- **Tests**: Added `HeadToHeadModuleTest`; H2H create/cancel/accept/confirm payout plus Livewire render flow pass. Match regression subset passes: 29 tests, 92 assertions.
- **PHPStan**: Attempted on H2H PHP files, but the runner exited with code 1 without diagnostics/output in this environment. PHP syntax checks passed for changed H2H PHP files.

---

## ✅ Welcome Logo Text Cleanup (v1.38)

- **`welcome.blade.php`**: Removed the visible `PLAYERSALOONS` wordmark text beside the header logo while keeping the logo image, page title, and image alt text intact.
- **Tests**: Not run; Blade-only visual cleanup.
- **PHPStan**: Not run; no PHP code changed.

---

## ✅ Match Confirmation Flow Alignment (v1.37)

- **`MatchStateMachine`**: Updated the canonical result flow to `IN_PROGRESS -> WAITING_FOR_CONFIRMATION -> COMPLETED/DISPUTED`. `RESULT_SUBMITTED` remains transition-compatible only for legacy rows.
- **`MatchAdmin` / `AdminDashboard`**: Aligned admin override and active-match counting with `WAITING_FOR_CONFIRMATION`.
- **Tests**: Updated match lifecycle tests to match auto-start behavior and the `ResolveDisputeAction` `User` actor contract. `MatchModuleTest`, `ConfirmResultFlowTest`, and `MatchStateMachineTest` pass: 24 tests, 75 assertions.
- **PHPStan**: Attempted at Level 5, but the runner exited with code 1 without diagnostics/output in this environment. PHP syntax checks passed for changed PHP files.

---

## ✅ Player Notification Bell (v1.36)

- **`NotificationBell`**: New Livewire component for the player dashboard topbar. Loads the latest 10 authenticated-user notifications, shows unread count/state, and supports single or bulk mark-as-read actions scoped through `auth()->user()->notifications()`.
- **Realtime frontend**: Added Laravel Echo + Pusher JS client wiring in `resources/js/app.js` for Laravel Reverb private user channels (`user.{uuid}`). Incoming `.notification.received` broadcasts dispatch a Livewire refresh event.
- **`dashboard.blade.php`**: Replaced static mock notification dropdown with the database-backed `<livewire:notification-bell />` component and exposes the authenticated user's UUID as a meta tag for Echo channel subscription.
- **Tests**: 6 tests in `NotificationBellTest`, all passing.
- **PHPStan**: 0 errors on changed PHP files at Level 5.

---

## ✅ Broadcast Notification Admin Panel (v1.35)

- **`BroadcastNotificationAdmin`**: New Livewire admin component at `/admin/notifications`. CRUD for `broadcast_messages` — create, edit, expire (all admins), delete permanently (SUPER_ADMIN only). Search by title/message, paginated list with status badges (Active/Scheduled/Expired).
- **Blade**: Modular partials — `_table.blade.php`, `_form-modal.blade.php`, `_confirm-modal.blade.php` — all reusable via `@include`.
- **`tests/TestCase.php`**: Added `withoutMiddleware(UpdateUserOnlineStatus::class)` globally to prevent Redis connection errors across all test HTTP requests.
- **`BroadcastMessage` model**: Added `@property` PHPDoc annotations + fixed `$fillable` to `list<string>`.
- **Tests**: 9 new tests in `BroadcastNotificationAdminTest` — access guards, create, edit, expire, delete (SUPER_ADMIN), search. All passing.
- **PHPStan**: 0 new errors at Level 5.

---

## ✅ Fix: missing `last_login_at` migration (v1.34)

- **`2026_06_19_112307_add_last_login_at_to_users_table.php`**: Added missing migration for `last_login_at` column on `users` table. Column was being updated in `Login.php` (since v1.29) but no migration existed — caused `SQLSTATE HY000: no such column` on local SQLite.
- **Tests**: No new tests — covered by existing login flow.
- **PHPStan**: N/A.

---

## ✅ Online presence tracking — Redis-based (v1.33)

- **`UpdateUserOnlineStatus`**: New middleware appended to `web` group. Sets `user_online:{id}` Redis key with 300s TTL on every authenticated request.
- **`User::isOnline()`**: New method — returns `true` if Redis key exists for the user.
- **`user-admin.blade.php`**: Added online dot indicator (emerald = online, slate = offline) next to username in the user list table.
- **Tests**: 4 new tests in `OnlinePresenceTest` — middleware sets key for auth user, skips guest, `isOnline()` true/false. All passing.
- **PHPStan**: 0 new errors at Level 5.

---

## ✅ Security tests — Tournament access controls (v1.32)

- **`TournamentSecurityTest`**: 3 new security-adjacent tests covering: Join button restricted to PLAYER role, player tournament listing filters out DRAFT/CANCELLED/COMPLETED statuses, and `viewRestrictedDetails` policy hides Matches/Players/Activity tabs from non-participants.
- **Tests**: 3 new tests, all passing.
- **PHPStan**: 0 errors at Level 5.

---

## ✅ NotifyAdminsOfKycSubmissionListener (v1.31)

- **`NotifyAdminsOfKycSubmissionListener`**: New queued listener on `notifications` queue. Handles `UserKycSubmitted` — sends an in-app notification to all users with `ADMIN` or `SUPER_ADMIN` role via `NotificationService`.
- **`EventServiceProvider`**: Registered `UserKycSubmitted → NotifyAdminsOfKycSubmissionListener`.
- **Tests**: 3 new tests in `NotifyAdminsOfKycSubmissionListenerTest` — admins notified, non-admins skipped, all admin roles covered. All passing.
- **PHPStan**: 0 errors on new files at Level 5.

---

## ✅ SSL env vars updated in Coolify (v1.30)

- **Deployment**: SSL now active on `app-testing.website`. Updated Coolify environment variables: `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true`, `REVERB_SCHEME=https`, `REVERB_PORT=443`. Restarted via Coolify (no redeploy needed).
- **Tests**: No code changes — config-only update.
- **PHPStan**: N/A.

---

## ✅ Quick Fixes & Production Verification (v1.29)

### `last_login_at` — now updated on login
- **`app/Livewire/Auth/Login.php`**: Added `$user?->update(['last_login_at' => now()])` after successful `Auth::attempt()`.
- **`app/Modules/Identity/Models/User.php`**: Added `last_login_at` to `$fillable` and `casts` (`'datetime'`). Column already existed in the migration.
- **Usage**: Currently recorded but not yet displayed in UI. Planned use: Admin User panel (last seen), future online presence tracking.

### Horizon Production Verified
- `/horizon` accessible at production URL. Status: **Active**. Workers confirmed running via `worker` container.
- Zero metrics are expected until real user activity generates jobs.

### Documentation Reorganization
- Deleted redundant files: `PlayerSaloons_New_Admin_Features_Implementation_Plan_v1.md`, `PlayerSaloons_Baseline_Addendum_v1.md`, all `Zone.Identifier` artifacts.
- Moved all docs to `documentation/` folder (git mv — history preserved).
- Created `documentation/ONBOARDING.md` — single start-here file with setup, conventions, doc update format, data storage map, Definition of Done, and feature/bug tracking guide.
- Created `documentation/guides/r2-storage-migration.md` — step-by-step R2 migration guide (Obsidian-compatible).
- Updated `README.md` to point to ONBOARDING.md.
- Fixed `.gitignore` — removed incorrect ignores of `/documentation` folder and root doc files.
